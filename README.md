# Short variant discovery in RNAseq data on Azure
This repository is an example of running the RNAseq short variant discovery pipeline, based on [Best Practices RNAseq Short Variant Discovery Pipeline by Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531192-RNAseq-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels-), on Cromwell on Azure.<br/> 

Learn more about using Azure for your Cromwell WDL workflows on our GitHub repo! - [Cromwell on Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure).<br/>

This repository is a fork from [the original](https://github.com/gatk-workflows/gatk4-rnaseq-germline-snps-indels) and has all the required changes to run the WDL workflow on Cromwell on Azure.<br/>

Here, you can find the WDL file and an example inputs JSON file with links to data hosted on a public Azure Storage account. You can use the "datasettestinputs" storage account directly as a relative path, like in the inputs JSON file.

The `gatk4-rna-germline-variant-calling.trigger.json` trigger file is ready to use. You can start the workflow on your instance of Cromwell on Azure, using [these instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/blob/master/docs/managing-your-workflow.md/#Start-your-workflow).


## gatk4-rnaseq-germline-snps-indels
### Purpose : 
Workflows for processing RNA data for germline short variant discovery with GATK v4 and related tools

### Requirements/expectations :
 - uBAM 

### Output :
 - A BAM file and its index.
 - A VCF file and its index. 
 - A Filtered VCF file and its index. 

### Software version :
 For program versions, see docker containers.

### Important Notes :
- The provided JSON is meant to be a ready to use example JSON template of the workflow. It is the userâ€™s responsibility to correctly set the reference and resource input variables.
